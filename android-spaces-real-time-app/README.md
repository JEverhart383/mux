# Mux Spaces SDK Example

This is an Android app demonstrating using the Spaces SDK to add real-time video and audio to your app. It is the same code as developed in the Getting Started guide [here](https://www.notion.so/Real-Time-Video-Getting-Started-Guide-for-Android-b21776d9a32d492ca4924176d4342b1d)

Note: The Spaces SDK is Beta software and may contain issues or missing functionality. We recommend against submitting apps based on it to the Play Store.

## Running the example

It is strongly recommended to follow the Getting Started guide [here](https://www.notion.so/Real-Time-Video-Getting-Started-Guide-for-Android-b21776d9a32d492ca4924176d4342b1d) and to run on actual non emulated devices.

As mentioned in the guide, you will need to replace "final String jwt = "YOUR JWT";" in MainActivity with your appropriate Mux JWT in order to run this example. For production use the JWT should be retrieved from a server at runtime.
