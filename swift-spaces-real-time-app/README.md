# Mux Spaces SDK Sample

This is an iOS and iPadOS app written in Swift demonstrating using the Spaces SDK to add real-time video and audio to your app.

Note: The Spaces SDK is Beta software and may contain issues or missing functionality. We recommend against submitting apps based on it to the App Store.

## Getting Started

The Spaces Swift SDK is available [here](https://github.com/muxinc/mux-spaces-sdk-swift-distribution). A step-by-step Getting Started guide that builds a simplified version of this example app can be found (here)[https://www.notion.so/mux/External-Real-Time-Video-Getting-Started-Guide-for-iOS-6b06eaf12764462d9782868316665082].
